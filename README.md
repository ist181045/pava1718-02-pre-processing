# Pre-Processing
### 2nd Advanced Programming Project - 17'18

---

### Problem Description

The goal of this project is to develop a language-independent pre-processor that
is programmable in Racket. Just like CPP and M4, the pre-processor reads input
files and writes output files, operating some transformations on those files.
The big difference between this pre-processor and other pre-processors comes, on
one hand, from the model used to process the transformations and, on the other
hand, from the programming language used to define those transformations.
